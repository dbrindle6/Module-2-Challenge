I did use ChatGPT to help me with this assignemnt. It to help me understand how to use syntax, and to understand the purpose behind syntax being used. 
It has also helped me understand how to structure my arguments, and to better understand some VBA concepts, and it helped me with dubugging.
I missed four productive days from work-travel, and have no prior coding experience. I followed their responses, but I typed along and asked questions if something was new or didn't make sense.
